Imagine a simple application where one can plug different database engines like Postgres or MongoDb as the persistence service.
Provide a sample code implementation where user can decide the database engine at the configuration level.

The task is to implement any model objects which can be persisted to the database, however, the database engine can be decided by the user configuration.
